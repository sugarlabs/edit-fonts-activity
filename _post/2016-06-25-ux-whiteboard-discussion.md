Yash has the core methods working (new, load, save, import, export) and is now working on the font manager parts of the activity. 

Eli and I met up to brainstorm the full UX, so that these core methods can be hooked together with the font manager part, and provide a framework to hang the glyph editor part on. 

This turned out as a 1h30m discussion:
