In the “GSOC Font Editor Next Steps” email thread Dave asked how we should measure fun. 
It's a good question, fun is subjective and not something that can simply be added to software like a widget or feature. 
So, I apologize for being vague when I said this font editor should be “fun”.

Fun is an outcome of play, and while we can't specifically ask the users to play, we can design the UI in a way that encourages it. 
Dave's idea of using the gamepad to manipulate points is a good example of this. 

This talk by Ian Bogost presents a good framework for designing software that facilitates fun:
