Eli and I met on IRC today to discuss the further tasks. 
Logs are available in [meeting.sugarlabs.org](http://meeting.sugarlabs.org/sugar-meeting/2016-05-09)

We discussed about the following UI mocks that Eli made. 
This is the mock from his [last post](ui-modes-and-toolsets) filled in with icons:

This shows some mode layout ideas:

We also briefly discussed [glyphs-mini](https://glyphsapp.com/glyphs-mini), a proprietary font editor only available on Mac OS X with a minified and uncluttered UI that some good ideas can be drawn from. 
Here is a [youtube video by Tyler Finck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9SqYnR-u7Y) showing the basic features:

We concluded that this weeks agenda should be:

* Go through Dave's [reading list](required-reading)
* Making a detailed task list for Milestone 1 in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/sugarlabs/edit-fonts-activity/milestones)
* Making a mock UI in PyGTK
