The issue with the stars next to the fonts is solved, closing [issue 16](https://github.com/sugarlabs/edit-fonts-activity/issues/16):

We can also change the Sample Text:

There are 2 types of fonts considered while making the Font Manager:
* __System Fonts__, stored in `/usr/share/fonts`, the activity will need root access to activate/deactivate fonts
* __User Fonts__, stored in `~/.fonts` if they are __Active__ or in `/home/<u-name>/.fonts-inactive` is they are __Inactive__

There are 3 states a font can be in:

* __Locked__(_permanently active_): all __System Fonts__ have this state as the activity cannot disable them

* __Active__(_temporarily active_): all __User Fonts__ which are active are shown with this icon

* __Inactive__(_temporarily inactive_): all __User Fonts__ which are inactive are shown with this icon

There is a edit font button in the row of the selected font next to active/inactive buttons. 
When clicked it opens up the font in the editor to be edited:
