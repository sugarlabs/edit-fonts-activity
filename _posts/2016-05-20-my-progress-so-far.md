Well, I haven't tried it 10,000 times, but have definitely found a lot of ways that things didn't work as I expected, during this community bonding phase.

I have read through the following links relevant to this GSoC - and more! 
As this not an exhaustive list, because I changed my machine recently... 
As a history dump it contains some less-relevant and not-project-specific links that I found relevant in some way:

As you may have noticed that there is debate going on the #sugar-meeting chanel on whether to use JS/HTML or Python/GTK to develop this activity. 
Also a 3rd way is to use Python Backend with Web UI suggested, by Dave.

The following is a try of the JS/HTML version of the app I started going through, with [ufoJS](http://lib.ufojs.org/) where I tried implementing the sample [glif-renderer](http://lib.ufojs.org/env/glif-renderer.xhtml) in hopes that I can hack it and make it display a Character Map. 
I faced some [issues](https://github.com/graphicore/ufoJS/issues/67) with **require.js** which were later solved with [Lasse Fister's](https://github.com/graphicore) help. 
The Character Map is still to be checked into Github. 

Then I tried making a Python/GTK stand-alone verision of the same character map, and ran into issues in drawing the glyphs with defcon. 
I emailed [Adri√©n Tetar](https://github.com/adrientetar) regarding it, but I'm yet to receive a reply.
This is what I have made so far:
[Python/GTK Mock](https://github.com/sugarlabs/edit-fonts-activity/tree/gh-pages/mockups/pyGtkMock)

Here is a screenshot for it:

In the last IRC meeting we discussed the platform issue, and figured out the right way to move forward is with Sugar Desktop.
