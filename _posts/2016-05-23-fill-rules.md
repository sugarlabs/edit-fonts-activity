Yash has already got glyph rendering going!

However, when filling the glyph, it isn't rendering the "counter" or white-shape:

![contour](files/img/2016-05-23-1.png)

The reason is that the default "fill rule" is using the "winding directions" of the contours. 
The pycairo documentation explains,

> Whether or not a point is included in the fill is determined by taking a ray from that point to infinity and looking at intersections with the path. 
> The ray can be in any direction, as long as it doesnâ€™t pass through the end point of a segment or have a tricky intersection such as intersecting tangent to the path. 
> (Note that filling is not actually implemented in this way. This is just a description of the rule that is applied.)

The default fill rule is `FILL_RULE_WINDING`:

    cairo.FILL_RULE_WINDING
    If the path crosses the ray from left-to-right, counts +1. 
    If the path crosses the ray from right to left, counts -1. 
    (Left and right are determined from the perspective of 
      looking along the ray from the starting point.) 
    If the total count is non-zero, the point will be filled.

But there is another fill rule:

    cairo.FILL_RULE_EVEN_ODD
    Counts the total number of intersections, without regard 
      to the orientation of the contour. 
    If the total number of intersections is odd, the point 
      will be filled.

<https://cairographics.org/documentation/pycairo/2/reference/constants.html#constants-fill-rule>

While `FILL_RULE_WINDING` is the rule used for PostScript, a simplified editor for kids should use `FILL_RULE_EVEN_ODD` and a 'correct directions' method should be auto-applied, so that kids don't have to think about winding directions.

Here is a simple demonstration, derived from the example in <https://www.cairographics.org/pycairo/tutorial/>:

```py
#!/usr/bin/env python

import math
import cairo

WIDTH, HEIGHT = 256, 256

def draw(output, evenodd=False):
    surface = cairo.ImageSurface (cairo.FORMAT_ARGB32, WIDTH, HEIGHT)
    ctx = cairo.Context (surface)
    ctx.scale (WIDTH, HEIGHT) # Normalizing the canvas
    if evenodd:
      ctx.set_fill_rule(cairo.FILL_RULE_EVEN_ODD)
    
    pat = cairo.LinearGradient (0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)
    pat.add_color_stop_rgba (1, 0.7, 0, 0, 0.5) # First stop, 50% opacity
    pat.add_color_stop_rgba (0, 0.9, 0.7, 0.2, 1) # Last stop, 100% opacity
    
    ctx.rectangle (0, 0, 1, 1) # Rectangle(x0, y0, x1, y1)
    ctx.set_source (pat)
    ctx.fill ()
    
    ctx.translate (0.1, 0.1) # Changing the current transformation matrix
    ctx.set_source_rgb (0.3, 0.2, 0.5) # Solid color
    ctx.set_line_width (0.02)
    
    ctx.move_to (0, 0)
    ctx.line_to (0.5, 0.1) # Line to (x,y)
    ctx.curve_to (0.5, 0.2, 0.5, 0.4, 0.2, 0.8) # Curve(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)
    ctx.close_path ()
    
    ctx.translate (0.15, 0.15) # Changing the current transformation matrix
    ctx.set_source_rgb (0.5, 0.5, 0.5) # Solid color
    ctx.set_line_width (0.2)
    ctx.move_to (0, 0)
    ctx.line_to (0.3, 0.1) # Line to (x,y)
    ctx.curve_to (0.3, 0.2, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.25) # Curve(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)
    ctx.close_path ()
    ctx.fill ()
    ctx.stroke ()
    
    surface.write_to_png(output) # Output to PNG

draw("2016-05-23-fill-example-1.png")
draw("2016-05-23-fill-example-2.png", evenodd=True)
```

Here is 2016-05-23-fill-example-1.png:

And here is 2016-05-23-fill-example-2.png with the "evenodd" fill rule set:
