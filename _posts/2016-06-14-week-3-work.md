During Week 2 I was away at a prior academic engagement agreed with Eli and Dave, and I will be working over the weekends to make up the time from now until the mid-term evaluation. 

During Week 3, I tackled the following 3 areas:

### Setting Up Travis

<https://github.com/sugarlabs/edit-fonts-activity/issues/17> tracked this request from Dave.

I couldn't get past an issue with the `./osbuild shell` command timing out every time, so I [raised an issue with travis-ci](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/6152) to learn how to overcome this.

### Python Modules for Font File Load, Save, Import, and Export

Inside the activity, all fonts are loaded as `defcon.Font` objects. 
They can be saved and exported in UFO, TTF, OTF formats. 
I have figured out the commands and the libraries regarding this and next steps are to write the modules in the main activty and connect them to standard Sugar Toolkit UI buttons and dialogs.

To load a UFO is done simply by using `defcon`:

    from defcon import Font
    font = Font(pathToUFO)

To import binary TTF and OTF fonts I have used [typesupply's extractor](https://github.com/typesupply/extractor) module.

    import extractor
    f = RFont()
    extractFontFromOpenType(pathTTF, f)

The next step is to convert the `RFont` object to a `defcon.Font` object.

To export binaries I have used [google i18n's ufo2ft](https://github.com/googlei18n/ufo2ft) module, the same as Trufont uses.

    from ufo2ft import compileTTF
    from robofab.world import OpenFont
    from defcon import Font
    ufo = OpenFont('abc.ufo')
    ttf = compileTTF(ufo)
    ttf.save('MyFont-Regular.ttf')

Dave has made issues to track each of these 4 features to completion:

* Saving a new font in UFO <https://github.com/sugarlabs/edit-fonts-activity/issues/32>
* Loading an existing UFO <https://github.com/sugarlabs/edit-fonts-activity/issues/33>
* Exporting a UFO as a OTF <https://github.com/sugarlabs/edit-fonts-activity/issues/34>
* Importing a OTF <https://github.com/sugarlabs/edit-fonts-activity/issues/35>

### Font Editor Pages

I developed a couple of Page classes for the different 'major mode' parts of the Activity.

A summary:

    class SummaryPage(Gtk.Box):
        """
        This Class Creates the "Font:<familyName>" Page 
        that loads up on clicking any Font
        """
        ...

And an editor:

    class EditorPage(Gtk.Box):
        """
        This Class Creates the "Let's Edit Font:<familyName>" Page 
        that loads up on clicking any Glyph in the Character Map or 
        when the edit font button is clicked on the Font Summary page
        """

I also developed a `PageManager` Class, which is a subclass of the `Gtk.Notebook` Class, that will manage all the pages or modes of the activity. 

Next steps are to make a singleton class so that there is only one instance of a `PageManager` Object, so I can switch to any page in the Notebook within any other class/file.
