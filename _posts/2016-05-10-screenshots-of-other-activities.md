Here are a selection of screenshots from a selection of Sugar Activities worth considering when brainstorming the Edit Fonts UX:

* no other controls

![FotoToon](files/img/third_party/screenshots/FotoToon.png)

* primary toolbar is tabbed
* current primary tab has interesting "+" icons
* no other controls

[Physics](http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4193):

![Physics](files/img/third_party/screenshots/Physics.png)

* primary toolbar is tabbed
* no other controls, super simple mode tools

[Turtle Blocks](http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4027):

![Turtle Blocks](files/img/third_party/screenshots/Turtle-Blocks.png)

* primary toolbar is NOT tabbed
* very full set of primary and secondary mode buttons
* note the dropdown at the end of the secondary toolbar
* floating (?) left side panel, with minus and right-arrow circle buttons

[cedit](http://activities.sugarlabs.org/en-US/sugar/addon/4708):

![cedit](files/img/third_party/screenshots/cedit.png)

* primary toolbar is NOT tabbed - the application has tabs for its documents. Perhaps better to have this tab bar at the bottom of the canvas, to avoid confusion with the Sugar HIG primary toolbar tabs?
* very slim set of primary and secondary mode buttons
